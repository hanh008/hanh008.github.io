      <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        Not being able to create a funtion for working out an average.
      </p>
      <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        Google and applied that format to my code.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        A little unsure as I didn't want to use the kata answers as I wanted to figure it out in a way that can be used again.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        Google provides a lot of answers but not everything. Sometimes it takes a few extra keywords.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        I struggled with writing pseudocode as I couldn't really break it down to what I needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>
        Flicking through my notes and trying something was a good way to just feel like I was able to get started.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        For a few errors, this helped a lot as I was able to see where exactly the error was.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        Extremely confident using this tool.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        Haven't really asked for much help up until now but will be using this more going forward.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to previous question. Has been fairly simple until JS so will be asking my coaches more questions.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Have been doing this a lot as it is a requirement but confident in this. My reflections are making me think a lot more about the learning objectives.
