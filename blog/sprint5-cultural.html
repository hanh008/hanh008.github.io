    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm not as good of a problem solver as I thought I was when it comes to new things. My attention span is very limited when it comes to productive work. My people skills are not where they need to be.
    </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      How relevant it is to any job/industry.
    </p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      Writing about it. When such topics come up, it is just listening to someone speaking about it.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
      It's a necessity of the industry. Maybe a lot of employers feel their staff do not have the right level of people skills.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3>
    <p>
      No, it is something I have not had a lot of training/learning on and is something I have wanted to develop. 
    </p>
    <h3>Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      No, I feel there is only so much of practicing programming my brain can handle. It depends of the type of practice; if it is learning lots of new material than I wouldn't take in a lot but if it is working on things I have already learned than that might help strengthen those practical skills.
