            <h1 class="title">Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>It allows people to understand the brain and that its networks are constantly changing to new experiences or knowledge. It also allows people to understand how learning works and how to optimise/enhance the education sector.</p>
            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>For coding, having the ability to think in way that more closely aligns to how a computer processes information for problem solving or writing code. Being able to change my own thought processes when I am in a coding environment.</p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Learning new systems and reinforcing those neurological pathways.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Research Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p>The mindset that your cognitive abilities are not set and can be altered to increase its output and therefore improve your cognitive abilities. It is relevant for a lot of people that may go into coding as this is something new and in a way abstract to the rest of the world.</p>
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>No, I have previously done some studies in psychology so have a basic understanding. I have always had a growth mindset.</p>
            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>To improve and to move from strength to strength. All tasks in this field are achievable as long as there is matching effort.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
            <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h3>
            <p>I have somewhat incorporated these understanding into my learning plan/strategy as the concepts were introduced in the prep work section.</p>
