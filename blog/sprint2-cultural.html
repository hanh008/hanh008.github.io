                <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
                <p>A strong ability to problem solve which I have been constantly working on. In my current job, I have had the opportunity to participate in training sessions. Applying it is the tricky part, I have had to facilitate multiple problem solves and also review problem solves from other teams sent through to mine. My attention span can be quite limited when it comes to study. I have always had this problem with study so is something I need to work on. </p>
                <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
                <p>I have set aside time, including time to rest/relax meaning I will be able to commit to this program. There will be weeks where I may fall a little behind but I do have this mapped out on my planner giving me time to catch up.</p>
                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
                <p>First resource to use is google. If that does not yield results, then I will use the foundation channel on slack or get into contact with my facilitator Ollie. Obviously move on to next section whilst waiting for a reply.</p>
                <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                <p>Somewhere I can go for help. Doesnâ€™t have to give me the answer but can direct me to where the possible solutions can be found. Instead of a teacher, my expectation is that they mentor me so that I can do things for myself.</p>
                <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
                <p>During foundations I will have no time for study on my roster days on. I work 12 hour shifts; need to rest and carry out life admin activities.</p>
