               <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
               <p>Your strength/abilities to understand your own and other people’s emotions. In terms with dealing with other people, it is paying attention to them and how they behave.</p>
               <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
               <p>IQ deals with a persons understanding/knowledge of the world around them. Not so much the emotional aspects but more the physical world, how it operates  and what’s happened or is currently happening.</p>
               <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
               <p>Unfortunately we live in a society where we have to communicate/work with others. This contributes to being able to build/maintain those relationships in a positive light.</p>
