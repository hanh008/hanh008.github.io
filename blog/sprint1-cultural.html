                <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h2>
                <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                <p>In my current role as a people leader which involves development and feedback. I carry out job interviews both internally and externally. As part of these interviews we have to provide feedback to candidates regardless of the outcome. This applies to the internal candidates as I work with them. Sometimes decisions are made that are out of my control. There can be pressure/influence from other leaders, some of which I report to. Even though some candidates were very good, they may have been blacklisted due to conflicts with other leaders. My belief is to hire based on merits such as abilities and good personality fits. I had to respect the decisions and opinions of others so had to make things work for everyone.</p>
                <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
                <p>The Chinese culture is family based and oriented. So those are some things that have stuck with me even though I grew up in NZ. Family to me is important and making sure those connections are well maintained. </p>

                <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</h2>
                <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                <p>Strengths would be my ability to quickly learn and being able to get into the mindset of overcoming issues. Limitations are a relatively short attention span with some things and quickly getting bored of what I do. In terms of career development I haven’t used my learning abilities to its best extent and haven’t spent the time in developing myself.</p>
                <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>
                <p>I have been trying to develop my people skills especially in my current role where I manage other staff. Problem solving and prioritisation are other key strengths that I bring. Also the ability to work under immense pressure.</p>
                <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h3>
                <p>I have had to complete everyday tasks with peers which shouldn’t be a problem. There are some people with difficult personalities, ie anger issues which none of the other staff wanted to work with. My strategy at the time was just to avoid them and only deal with them when it was absolutely necessary. It was effective in that there wasn’t any tension as I wouldn’t have to deal with them. I don’t think I would do anything differently. But maybe would try bringing someone in as a mediator to see if we can resolve why they had anger issues.</p>
