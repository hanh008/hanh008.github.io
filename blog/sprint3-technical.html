                <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h3>
                <p>HTML and CSS are similar to a rugby team. With HTML being the forwards that get the grunt work done up front. CSS are the backs, one important role of the half back is to control the defensive line of the forwards which is like the class attribute. Another role of CSS is to polish off and create stylie manoeuvres which HTML has created.</p>
                <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
                <p>Control flow is the order a set of code is executed. Loops are the amount of times a function repeats until it reaches a set value. An everyday example would be cooking a meal. The control flow would relate to meal prep, cooking the meal and then cleaning which is the order things are carried out. The loop would be how many times you cook a week until you go get takaways.</p>
                <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                <p>The Document Object Model is a programming interface that was designed to be independent of any particular language. It is used to read and manipulate the webpage.</p>
                <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                <p>An array is basically an object with methods. Arrays are faster than objects when running certain functions.</p>
                <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                <p>A function is a executable code/action that can be called on by an external code to return a value. They are useful as they make webpages interactive by carrying out tasks when users make selections or additions to webpages.</p>
