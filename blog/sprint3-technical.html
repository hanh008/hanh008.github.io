                <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h3>
                <p>HTML and CSS are similar to a rugby team. With HTML being the forwards that get the grunt work done up front. CSS are the backs, one important role of the half back is to control the defensive line of the forwards which is like the class attribute. Another role of CSS is to polish off and create stylie manoeuvres which HTML has created.</p>
                <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. </h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
